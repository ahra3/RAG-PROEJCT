### Overview

In this exercise, you will build an **onboarding assistant** for the **Umbrella Corporation**, a fictional company from the *Resident Evil* franchise. The assistant will guide new employees through company policies, answer questions about internal regulations, and provide personalized responses based on the employee's information. You will use **Streamlit** to build a graphical user interface and **LangChain** to integrate **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The assistant will augment its responses using a vector store filled with information extracted from a provided PDF of Umbrella Corporation's internal regulations.

The assistant will leverage two data sources:
1. **Employee-specific data**: Generated by a synthetic data generator that emulates an employee database.
2. **Company policies and regulations**: Retrieved from the provided PDF, stored in a local vector database, and used to answer questions relevant to Umbrella Corporation's rules.

### Business Context: Umbrella Corporation Employee Onboarding

The **Umbrella Corporation** is a large, multinational company involved in pharmaceutical development, genetic research, and biotechnology. While known for its cutting-edge work, the company also maintains strict internal policies and procedures, making it essential for new employees to quickly familiarize themselves with various rules and regulations. 

The onboarding assistant you will create is designed to help new employees by providing personalized answers to their questions about company policies, benefits, work schedules, safety protocols, and other key aspects of their employment at Umbrella Corporation. The assistant will personalize its responses based on the specific employee interacting with it and will also retrieve answers from a vector store of the company's internal regulations.


Good luck!
